As for finding companies that invest in junior engineers, definitely read everything you can about the company on Glassdoor, and any other review site (Blind, etc.). But most importantly, read what they put out. Most companies with decent engineering departments have blogs they maintain, where they will talk about their methodology and technicaly challenges - how they treat juniors, growth, process, what they are working on, cool things they learned etc. Also, often individuals at a company may have personal blogs where they talk about their tech challenges. Reading these blogs will give you some insight. Also, there are a lot of meetups and communities (slacks, etc.) of the dev community in NYC and people talk. 


Expectations:
  * What are your expectations of junior engineers?  
  * What does your engineering ladder look like?
  * What are the requirements for advancing up the ladder and specifically the next level for me? How will those criteria be evaluated?
  * How will I know if I'm succeeding or not? 
Onboarding
  * What kind of onboarding do you have for new engineers? 
  * Is it different for junior engineers?
  * What is the roadmap for me? 30/60/90 day plan? When do you consider me fully onnboarded?
Growth
  * How do you invest in the growth of your engineering team?
  * Do you have any frameworks in place to help your engineering team grow their skills both technically and otherwise?
Culture
  * What is the work life balance like on the team?
  * How does your team handle support rotations? (will give you a sense for any off-hours expectations)
Internship/Apprentice
  * In general these questions are pretty similar to being a junior:
  * What are your expectations for the role?
  * What does success look like?
  * What kind of onboarding is there for that role?
  * What kind of supervision and guidance should I expect?
  * What is the timeline of this role, and what/when is there an evaluation?
  * What does this role lead to? Is there a full-time job that it can transition to?
