The smartest tactic to skip all the bs !!!

See a job you loke ? Dont apply

Google the company, find their number and call

"Hey, so I was trying to apply to a position for "XYZ Company" and I couldnt actually get it to work ... the website redirects me to somewhere else and I couldnt sign up or anyrhing. So I was wondering if there was an email of someone I could contact directly about the position? Anything I should put in the subject line so it doesnt get marked as spam or anything? Ok great. Should I tell her that you sent me? What was your name ?




"Hey, so this is probaby not the right number to call. I tried to call the desk but it was busy. Basically I was trying to apply to a job there and the website wont work. And I know its not your specialty but I was wondering if there was an email so I can email somebody or anything like that. It takes me to the recruiting site and when I click apply it just gives me a 401 error, so.. not sure what to do. Would you like to know the position I'm trying to apply for? __  ___  get email ___, Should I tell him that you sent me ?
