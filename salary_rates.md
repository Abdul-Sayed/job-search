Internship: 15-35/hr, sometimes higher if you're at a very large company, I've seen 20-25 most commonly.

Upon Job Offer:

“Thank you, I’m so excited. I look forward to reviewing the offer details, and getting back to you with any questions!” 

Then review their written offer/letter of agreement/employment contract. 

Check for and negotiate vacation, working remotely, benefits, perks, review cycle, or work-life balance
whether mentorship is offered at the company -> “How do you approach onboarding employees?”

Inquire when your next salary review would be

To average 70k/yr,

Junior Devs can start as interns for $55k, then after 3 months work for $65k/yr and get a raise to $95k/yr after 6 months

Do salary research on payscale, salary.com, glassdoor , ONet, CareerOneStop, BLSbeforehand

Then say :
    “I want to reiterate by sharing how incredibly excited I am about contributing to the Company X team.”
    “I was wondering if there was room to discuss the possibility of bumping the compensation closer to the market average which is $75k in NYC.”
Or
    “I was wondering if it were possible to bump salary closer to the $70-80k range.”
    “However, I am flexible and happy to discuss further!”




If you are asked for your salary expectations over email, in most cases it is best practice to kindly ask the employer if they have a few minutes to speak on the phone about compensation. 


“I understand the market rate for this position in [insert your city] is $X - $Y and I’m comfortable with that range. How does that align with the compensation you have in mind for this role?”

“Based on my research, I’ve seen that average salaries for a company of your size and a role like this are between $X and $Y - does that align with what you've budgeted for this role?"

“Based on my past experiences and what I know this position in [insert your city] earns on average, I’m looking in the (similar) range of $X - $Y. So that I have an idea of your budget and expectations, is this in line with the range you are considering for this role?”
