Internship: 15-35/hr, sometimes higher if you're at a very large company, I've seen 20-25 most commonly. 
Apprenticeship: 55-85k a year, usually sitting in the 65-75 range.
Junior-level software engineers/developers $60-90K.


Upon Job Offer:
Ask about or negotiate vacation, working remotely, benefits, perks, review cycle, or work-life balance
whether mentorship is offered at the company -> “How do you approach onboarding employees?”

To average 70k/yr,

Junior Devs can start as interns for $55k, then after 3 months work for $65k/yr and get a raise to $95k/yr after 6 months

Or just start at $27.5/hr as an intern, then work at $85k/yr when your hired as a junior dev

Do salary research on payscale, salary.com, glassdoor beforehand

If you are asked for your salary expectations over email, in most cases it is best practice to kindly ask the employer if they have a few minutes to speak on the phone about compensation. 


“I understand the market rate for this position in [insert your city] is $X - $Y and I’m comfortable with that range. How does that align with the compensation you have in mind for this role?”

“Based on my research, I’ve seen that average salaries for a company of your size and a role like this are between $X and $Y - does that align with what you've budgeted for this role?"

“Based on my past experiences and what I know this position in [insert your city] earns on average, I’m looking in the (similar) range of $X - $Y. So that I have an idea of your budget and expectations, is this in line with the range you are considering for this role?”
